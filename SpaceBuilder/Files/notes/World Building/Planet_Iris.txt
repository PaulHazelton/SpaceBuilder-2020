Iris:	The silicon planet of rainbows

Silicon Carbide, Zircon

Alien Idea: Alien turns to soup and transforms like a caterpiller

PLANET DETAILS:
	Temperature:
		Close to sun, hot
	Size:
		Larger
	Atmosphere:
		Silane (flamable, stinky), Oxygen, Sulfuric Acid (gas), hydrogen, nitrogen, (Clear)
	Oceans:
		Sulfuric Acid disolved in water (Clear)
		Silicon dioxide shores (fine white powder) with fumes
	Surface:
		Lots of silicon, iron, quartz, and silicon carbide
		Living mountains create extreme terrain with massive clifs.
	Appearence:
		Yellow-red-ish sky
		Clear quartz surface with iridescent silicon carbide and metalic silicon below.
	Notes:
		Silicon and oxygen produces quartz.
		Hazardous to humans
		Silicon Carbide (most of the crust) does not melt, is very strong.
		Much of the crust is living, collecting energy. This creates a conflict: many desire to mine the planet for its energy.

	SILICON CARBIDE SUPER MATERIAL:
		Low Density
		High specific heat
		Low Thermal Expansion
		High Thermal Conductivity
		High Hardness
		Excellent Thermal shock resistance
		Chemical Inertness
		Possible Names:
			Organic Silicon Carbide, OSC
			Biotic Silicon Carbide,  BSC
			Biotic Moissanite
			Black Rock
			Angel Rock
			Living Rocks

LIFE:
	Details:
		Silicon based life, nitrogen based genes
		Energy is taken from the sun and the hydrogen in the air
		Many animals eat by absorbing prey
		Called Metalloids
	Plant Life:
		Oceans:
			Metalic Moss
			There is tree like sea grass, with fauna above the surface and roots that hang in the oceans
			Metalic Coral, low density dead-tree like appearence
		Land:
			Metalic moss grows everywhere
			There is an abundance of gigantic metalic tree-like plants.
				They have a chrome like appearence due to the 
			Living mountains and living ground are abundant.
				These giant living structures have a low density lattice structure that facilitates air flow.
				They consume the air and collect energy, thus they grow to extreme sizes and are very strong.
				The structure is rich with a silicon carbide metamaterial
	Animal Life:
		Oceans:
			Microbs
				eat metalic moss, live on sea floor
			Wet Metalic Crab
				small crab like animal lives on sea floor eating microbs and metalic moss
			Skinner
				Tall Skinny animals that breath air and eat crabs
			Angel Hair Squid
				Small fish with many thin long hairs that are used for propolsion
				eats metalic crabs
			Serator Shark
				Large fish that eats smaller fish
				Swims with 2 tails: the tails are wrapped around the sides, then fan out toward the back and meet propelling the fish forward
				 Then the tails curl back up to the sides.
				Two serated jaws on the front are used for eating. The closed jaws are used to pierce the prey, then they are opened to meet
				 the sides of the fish, clamping both halfs of the prey between the extended jaws and the sides. The prey is then absorbed.
		Land:
			Microbs
			Quartz Bug
				Roll around collecting moss, transparent
			Dry Metalic Crab
				Small strandbeast like animal that appears like a crab.
				Eats metalic moss, microbs, quartz bugs
			Angelic whisp
				Flies in a similar manner to the angel hair squid
				Stomps on Crabs to eat them.

	Inteligent Life:
		Called:
			Silicate
			Metallicon
		Origin:
			Evolved in a similar way to humans, eating animals
		Appearence:
			Metalic
		Biology:
			Computer like brain, highly intelligent.
			They interface with computers easily, and do so often
			Silicon carbide bones
			Silicon rubber for joints and muscles
		Culture:
			Very logical
			Very Defensive
