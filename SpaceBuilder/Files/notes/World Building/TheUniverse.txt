SILICONO:	The silicon planet

PLANET DETAILS:
	Temperature:
		Close to sun, hot
	Size:
		Larger
	Atmosphere:
		Silane (flamable, stinky), Oxygen, Sulfuric Acid (gas), hydrogen, nitrogen, (Clear)
	Oceans:
		Sulfuric Acid disolved in water (Clear)
		Silicon dioxide shores (fine white powder) with fumes
	Surface:
		Lots of silicon, iron, quartz, and living mountains and grounds
		Living mountains create extreme terrain with massive clifs.
	Appearence:
		Clear quartz surface with metalic silicon and iron below.
	Notes:
		Silicon and oxygen produces quartz.
		Hazardous to humans
		Much of the crust is living, collecting energy. This creates a conflict: many desire to mine the planet for its energy.

LIFE:
	Details:
		Silicon based life, nitrogen based genes
		Energy is taken from the sun and the hydrogen in the air
		Called Metalloids
	Plant Life:
		Oceans:
			There is tree like sea grass, with fauna above the surface and roots that hang in the oceans
		Land:
			Metalic moss grows everywhere
			There is an abundance of gigantic metalic tree-like plants.
			Living mountains and living ground are abundant.
				These giant living structures have a low density lattice structure that facilitates air flow.
				They consume the air and collect energy, thus they grow to extreme sizes and are very strong.
	Animal Life:
		Oceans:
		Land:

	Inteligent Life:	Metalic
		Origin:
			Evolved in a similar way to humans, eating animals
		Appearence:
			Metalic
		Biology:
			Computer like brain, highly intelligent.
			They interface with computers easily, and do so often
		Culture:
