Human race idea:

People cure "ageing". Telomeres are made in the cell so they don't stop splitting because they get too short.

*Some* people live really long. Many still die of disease and accidents. Careful people live for 100s of years. Overpopulation causes people to colonize other planets and spread across the galaxy. This creates the modern space fairing human that can live for 100s of years.
