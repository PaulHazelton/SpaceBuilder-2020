Notes on new grid based method of building
2020-0531-1609

LIGHTBULB MOMENT!:
	Very large 2D array (full of pointers?)
	OR! A list of CHUNKS, where each chunk is a reasonable 2D array
	Each square has information:
		A pointer to a block
		Boolean occupied
		4 sides
			buildable
			sealed
	What if there is a large block?
		1 large block occupies many cells.
		Each cell occupied by the same block points to the same block.

Scratch notes:
	Connection Points might still be a good idea.
	For blocks with odd shapes, such as triangles:
		Don't allow a block to connect if it doesn't make sense.
	
	For blocks that are bigger than 1x1:
		Don't use many 1x1 blocks, stupid.
		Mouse aligns to center or top left. (center prolly)
	
	Build Suggestions:
		Block in hand always aligns to grid.
		If block in hand cannot connect to existing blocks, then just don't show ghost.
	
	Block Grid:
		Array list of blocks
		Blocks are aligned by INTEGERS
	
	BlockBody:
		This class either needs to completely change,
		or use a new class called BlockGrid.
