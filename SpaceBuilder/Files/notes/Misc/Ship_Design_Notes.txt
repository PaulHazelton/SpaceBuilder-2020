Every Ship/Station is made of polygons.

Every polygon has a back, middle, and front parts.
Some of these parts may be invisible and/or no-physics

Most parts will have a silhouette drawn behind the image with
transparencies, the user will pick a color for the silhouette.

The air vents will be weak points

"Empty blocks" don't need a back, empty middle, and front,
they just need a back and a front. (you can walk through it
though)
